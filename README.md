# CSE3241-Warehouses-Database-Application

Team: Nelly Azar, Lisha Nawani, Tuhin Patel, Vishal Kumar

Done in conjunction with CSE3241 throughout the semester, the team was given a simulation involving a newly opened warehouse that required a DMBS and a client-side application to add, remove, modify,
and query data from the server. 

From the prompt, a normalized database schema was created, which is reflected in the raw database file, as well as each .txt file containing the SQLite code used to instantiate the server.

On the client side, the application functionality is done through the command line. There, the user will input a command of their choice and any applicable follow-up answers, such that the command can be 
executed error-free on the server side.
